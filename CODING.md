#Aka “How to get my pull-request accepted”

1. The code is not complete until there are [unit tests.][1]
2. The PR won't be accept until there are integration tests.
3. Code tells you how, [comments tell you why.][2]
4. Simple is better than complex. [Complex is better than complicated.][3]
5. `\n` is the one true line ending. `\r\n` and `\r` lead to woe and the [wall of pink.][4]
6. Write useful [commit messages.][5]
7. Do commit frequently and rebase as necessary.
8. Do not vent your frustrations in the commit message; [a blank line is more useful.][6]

#Things that will make the workflow delightful
1. Use the [JIRA ingegration][7] in your branch names, commit messages, and pull requests.
