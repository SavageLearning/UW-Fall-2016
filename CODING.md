Aka “How to get my pull-request accepted”

1. The code is not complete until there are unit tests. 
2. The code won’t pass CI until there are integration test.
3. Code tells you how, comments tell you why. 
4. Simple is better than complex. Complex is better than complicated. 
5. `\n` is the one true line ending. `\r\n` and `\r` lead to woe and the wall of pink. 
6. Write useful commit messages. 
7. Do commit frequently and rebase as necessary.
8. Do not vent your frustrations in the commit message; a blank line is more useful.
