# Todo list for new volunteers

1. Create a github.com account if you don't already have one
2. Create a github [issue](https://github.com/SavageLearning/UW-Fall-2016/issues) in this repo with your name, so I know your github ID. 
3. Find the gitter chat room and say 'Hi!'
[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/machete-project/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/machete-project/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/machete-project/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
4. Make sure you've received an invite to the JIRA board
5. Be sure to ask about the field trip to [Casa Latina](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Casa+Latina+Seattle/@47.5995476,-122.312727,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x54906ac022bf5d2b:0x9c0aff2719871584!8m2!3d47.5995476!4d-122.310533). It's early on Saturday 10/1/2016.
